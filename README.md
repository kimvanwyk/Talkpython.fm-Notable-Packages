# TalkPython['Podcast'] Compilation of Notable PyPI Packages

I love listening [Talk Python To Me Podcast](https://talkpython.fm/), a weekly podcast hosted by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) dedicated the people and ideas in Python. The show covers a wide array of Python topics as well as many related topics (e.g. MongoDB, AngularJS, DevOps). He has a casual 45 minute conversation with industry experts. At the end of each episode, Michael asks two questions:

1. If you're going to write some Python code. What editor do you use?
2. Any notable PyPI (or Conda) package?

This is a community & unofficial compilation of those amazing Notable PyPI or Conda Python Packages highligted at the end of the show.

Package: **Stevedore - Manage dynamic plugins for Python applications** [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/stevedore/) | [Website](https://docs.openstack.org/stevedore/latest/) | [Source Code](https://opendev.org/openstack/stevedore)

Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions ("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using __import__ or importlib. Stevedore avoids creating yet another extension mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.
