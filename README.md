# TalkPython['Podcast'] Compilation of Notable PyPI Packages

I love listening [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/), a weekly podcast hosted by Michael Kennedy dedicated to Python. The show covers a wide array of Python topics as well as many related topics (e.g. MongoDB, AngularJS, DevOps). He has a casual 45 minute conversation with industry experts. At the end of each episode, Michael asks two questions:

1. If you're going to write some Python code. What editor do you use?
2. Any notable PyPI (or Conda) package?

This is a community & unofficial compilation of those amazing Notable PyPI or Conda Python Packages highligted at the need of the show.

CuPy is an open-source array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python. CuPy utilizes CUDA Toolkit libraries including cuBLAS, cuRAND, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE, cuFFT, cuDNN and NCCL to make full use of the GPU architecture. Basically, NumPy on steroids!
