# TalkPython['Podcast'] Compilation of Notable PyPI Packages

I love listening [Talk Python To Me Podcast](https://talkpython.fm/), a weekly podcast hosted by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) dedicated to the people and ideas in Python. The show covers a wide array of Python topics as well as many related topics (e.g. MongoDB, AngularJS, DevOps). He has a casual 45 minute conversation with industry experts. At the end of each episode, Michael asks two questions:

1. If you're going to write some Python code. What editor do you use?
2. Any notable PyPI (or Conda) package?

This is a community & unofficial compilation of those amazing Notable PyPI (or Conda) Python Packages highligted at the end of the show.

Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions ("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using __import__ or importlib. Stevedore avoids creating yet another extension mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.

The question was not asked, but since the team talked about Airflow..

Package: **Apache Airflow** - *Programmatically author, schedule and monitor data pipelines* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/) | [Website](https://airflow.apache.org/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/apache/airflow)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12855744/134873876-146ad757-d8e1-4b80-8b85-7a99dcfb43c4.png" width="50%">

Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include Luigi, Oozie and Azkaban.

Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's Xcom feature). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.

Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN. You don't need to replace the Python interpreter, run a separate compilation step, or even have a C/C++ compiler installed.

NetworkML is the machine learning portion of our Poseidon project. The model in networkML classifies each device into a functional role via machine learning models trained on features derived from network traffic. "Functional role" refers to the authorized administrative purpose of the device on the network and includes roles such as printer, mail server, and others typically found in an IT environment. Our internal analysis suggests networkML can achieve accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in the high 90's when trained on devices from your own network. Whether this performance can transfer from IT environment to IT environment is an active area of our research. Dear network administrator üèÉüèÉüèÉüèÉüèÉ, NetworkML predicts the functional role of network-connected device via network traffic analysis and machine learning.

notable 'PyPI'package, if you want, you can shout out 'Tenacity' which we covered or something else if you'd like tenacity, and 'jQuery', which I love. jQuery is a tiny wrapper around the logging system, or parents or the stories that I never remember how to configure the logging system in Python, like I do involve logging in a lot. Like, I don't know, to configure it to work like I want. So jQuery does that. It's pretty easy to use it as a function of functional approach, like diversity in its

Package: **tenacity** - *Retry code until it succeeds* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tenacity/) | [Website](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/jd/tenacity)

Tenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything. It originates from a fork of retrying which is sadly no longer maintained. Tenacity isn't api compatible with retrying but adds significant new functionality and fixes a number of longstanding bugs.

notable 'PyPI' packages, I know, you pick two that have some relation back to this challenge of building binary stuff and distributing it. Yeah. So up until December, there was exactly one computer in the world that could build pi 'pyzmq'releases. That's my laptop. And I finally solved that problem, thanks to two wonderful packages. One is 'ci build wheel', which is a more general useful if you have compiled 'Python' packages, 'ci build' builds a wonderful thing for building and distributing all

Python wheels are great. Building them across Mac, Linux, Windows, on multiple versions of Python, is not. ```cibuildwheel``` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

With a unified view of jobs and the assets they produce, Dagster can schedule and orchestrate Pandas, Spark, SQL, or anything else that Python can invoke. Dagster is designed for data platform engineers, data engineers, and full-stack data scientists. Building a data platform with Dagster makes your stakeholders more independent and your systems more robust. Developing data pipelines with Dagster makes testing easier and deploying faster.

Bleach is an allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips markup and attributes. Bleach can also linkify text safely, applying filters that Django's urlize filter cannot, and optionally setting rel attributes, even on links already in the text. Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from untrusted sources. If you find yourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of things, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or don't.
