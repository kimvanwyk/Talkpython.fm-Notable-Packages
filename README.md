# TalkPython['Podcast'] Compilation of Notable PyPI Packages

I love listening [Talk Python To Me Podcast](https://talkpython.fm/), a weekly podcast hosted by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) dedicated the people and ideas in Python. The show covers a wide array of Python topics as well as many related topics (e.g. MongoDB, AngularJS, DevOps). He has a casual 45 minute conversation with industry experts. At the end of each episode, Michael asks two questions:

1. If you're going to write some Python code. What editor do you use?
2. Any notable PyPI (or Conda) package?

This is a community & unofficial compilation of those amazing Notable PyPI or Conda Python Packages highligted at the end of the show.

Package: **CuPy : NumPy & SciPy for GPU** [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/cupy/) | [Website](https://cupy.dev/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/)

CuPy is an open-source array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python. CuPy utilizes CUDA Toolkit libraries including cuBLAS, cuRAND, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE, cuFFT, cuDNN and NCCL to make full use of the GPU architecture. Basically, NumPy & SciPy on steroids!

Package: **Stevedore - Manage dynamic plugins for Python applications** [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/stevedore/) | [Website](https://docs.openstack.org/stevedore/latest/) | [Source Code](https://opendev.org/openstack/stevedore)

Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions ("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using __import__ or importlib. Stevedore avoids creating yet another extension mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.

Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters. We all love Black!

The question was not asked, but since the team talk about Airflow..

Package: **Apache Airflow - Programmatically author, schedule and monitor data pipelines** [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/) | [Website](https://airflow.apache.org/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/apache/airflow)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12855744/134873876-146ad757-d8e1-4b80-8b85-7a99dcfb43c4.png" width="50%">

Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include Luigi, Oozie and Azkaban.

Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's Xcom feature). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.
